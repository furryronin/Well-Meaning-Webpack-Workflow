A basic Webpack build process for developing static HTML websites and applications. All comments welcome.

## Features

- Write SCSS and modern JavaScript code in `src` and build minified, transpiled code for production in `dist`
- Live reloading with webpack-dev-server
- ES6+ to ES5 transpilation, bundling, and minification
- SCSS to CSS transpilation, bundling, autoprefixing, and minification
- Automatic copying of HTML and static assets from `src` to `dist` folders
- Linting for styles and scripts
- A template engine (Handlebars)

## Installation

Installs with the package manager of your choice, for instance node or yarn

`npm install`

or

`yarn install`

## Usage

- Write all your ES2015+ Javascript code in `src/js` and SCSS styling in `src/style`. Store static assets in `src/static`. Organize HTML files the way you like.
- Available commands:
  - `npm run build`: Build files to the `dist` folder. Transpiles down to ES5 and bundles all JS into `app.bundle.js`. Transpiles SCSS to CSS and adds prefixing into `style.bundle.css`. Copies static assets and HTML over, and bundled CSS and JS gets added to HTML file.
  - `npm run start:dev`: Runs `webpack-dev-server` at `localhost:9000`. Includes live reloading on any Javascript/SCSS/HTML changes.
  - `npm run start`: Builds files and runs a local production server on `localhost:8080` with `http-server`.
  - `npm run run lint:js`: Lints JS with ESLint.
  - `npm run lint:styles`: Lints SCSS stylesheets with stylelint.
  - `npm run lint:html`: Lints HTML for a11y issues using pa11y, performs a  fresh build runs on the dist folder to check your work.
